    <h2>The long-lost son of Shaquille O'Neal, Alexis Urbain-Racine
    was abandoned on a snowy peak at birth and left to die. Against all odds,
     he survived and was raised by a pack of wolves. At the age of 12
     and after rigorous mountain training, he returned to civilization
     to fulfill his destiny as the defender of earth. He was crowned king of
     the world after warding off the threatening Zerg invasion. He now lives
     wherever the heck he pleases, as he owns a house in literally every single country on earth
     (yes, including the Vatican).
